# BarkersAcademy

This project was create to provide online video courses for dog training! Some key features include a fun video that plays when you first visit the site, a calculator that lets you convert your dogs age into human years, and LIVE links to dogs that are waiting to be adopted!

This website was created as a final project for my Web Side Client Development class!
