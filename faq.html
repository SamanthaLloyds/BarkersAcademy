      <h2>Doesn’t my dog need an in-person trainer?</h2>
      <p>For the vast majority of dogs – no. Our instructor and head trainer Steffi Trott started out as an in-person dog trainer, and after training with hundreds of dogs and owners for years knew that most of them actually do not need a local trainer – they simply need positive, step-by-step instruction.
        <b>No trainer can “fix” a dog in a training session or two</b>. The real changes happen through training at home, where the owner shows the dog exactly what behaviors pay off and get rewarded.
        You as the owner are the #1 trainer your dog needs.
        Nobody knows him as well as you do, which gives you a great start as a teacher.
        And we will help you teach him in the best, most effective way.
      </p>
      <h2>How do the courses work?</h2>
      <p>
        Our courses take you through each training program with a variety of <b>explanations and training videos</b>. The video lessons show you how to teach every single behavior from the very beginning until it is perfected. We point out what you need to pay attention to, how often to train, when to reward your dog etc.
        And we show you different exercises with different breeds of dogs, too!
        Because we know that life happens and things can get in the way of dog training, all our <b>courses are lifetime access</b> – pay once, and always come back to revisit and train again. That’s much better value than any in-person training!
      </p>
      <h2>Do I have to be online at a specific time?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Not at all</b>. All our courses are pre-recorded and ready to go for you whenever you like. <b>As soon as you sign up</b>, you can view the whole course.
        Because our classes have lifetime access, you can train today, in a week, in a month or in a year – the classes will always be there for you.
      </p>
      <h2>When can I expect results?</h2>
      <p>
        If you train for only 5-10 minutes every day, you will definitely see <b>big changes after a few weeks</b>.
        Many owners however report that their dogs already catch on after the first few training sessions and <b>have learned several new behaviors just a couple days of training</b>.
